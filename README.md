# Reservoir facies classification from seimsic data using deep 3D CNNs
## The tensorflow implementation for estimating/inferring reservoir facies (rock type) from seimsic data

The prediction variable is  facies (rock class) at every pixel of a 3D discretized grid of the petroleum reservoir (see top right image below). In the images below, the plane formed by *x* and *y* dimensions refer to the surface plane of the earth. The 'depth' dimension of facies model refers to depth below the earth surface.

The data we have is volumes of seismic data (see top right image below). Note seismic data also had *x* and *y* dimensions. But, it has a Seismic cubes can have differe
